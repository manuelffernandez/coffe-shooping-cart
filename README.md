# Final project of the JS course by Coderhouse
## About this site :globe_with_meridians:

### Coffeeshop e-shop prototype :coffee:
This is a fictional e-shop website that emulates a shopping cart. 
The logic of the app is made using vanilla JS.

Logo and color palette were selected by me.

### Libraries :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
I used two libraries to improve the UX. These were added by CDN, so npm install isn't required.

**Toastify** --> 
https://github.com/apvarun/toastify-js

**Sweetalert2** --> 
https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2

### What it does :grey_question:
The main functionality it's add or remove products in your cart and therefore the program will calculate the subtotals and total of the check.
It also have some extras functionalities to improve the UX:
* The disability of the adds buttons when you already have the corresponding product in your cart.
* Small alerts will display when you reach the max stock available or when you try to remove less than 1 product unit.
* The DOM section where the cart is displayed disappears  when you dont have any products in it.
